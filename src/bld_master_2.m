function [Ef] = bld_master_2(mat);
% Usage: [Ef] = bld_master_2(mat);
%
% General: Builds up the main compartment (GAP-SHUNT) of the system matrix for the complete electrode model. It is called within the function fem_master_full.
%
% Input:
% mat - reference admittivity at each element (in the complex case mat(i) = sigma(i) - epsilon(i)) {k x 1}
%
% ver 2. assumes globals and supports anisotropy
% 
% Output:
% Ef - unreferenced GAP based system matrix {n x n}
